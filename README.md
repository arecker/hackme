# Hacking Challenge

Go to this website and try to guess the password.  Try as many times as you'd like.

Pretty tedious, huh?  Good thing we know how to write python.  Today we're going to write a python program that will guess the password for us.  All we'll need to do is give it a long list of password to try, then we just let it rip!  Let's get started.

First, let's create an empty file in our workstation.  I'm going to call mine `guess.py`, but feel free to name it whatever you'd like, as long as it doesn't have any weird characters in it.
